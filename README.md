## 📚 Implemented Structures

### **Core ADTs**
- **Trees**
  - Binary Search Tree (BST)
  - AVL Tree
  - Treap
- **Linear Structures**
  - Singly Linked List
  - Doubly Linked List (supports circular configuration)
- **LIFO/FIFO**
  - Stack (Static/Dynamic/Generic implementations)
  - Queue (Generic)

---

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- C compiler (GCC/Clang recommended)
- Standard C library

### Basic Usage
1. Clone repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/voidashi/ADTs-Collection.git
   ```
2. Include desired headers in your code:
   ```c
   #include "linkedlist.h"  // For linked list operations
   ```
3. Compile with your source:
   ```bash
   gcc -o your_program your_code.c
   ```

## ⚙️ Key Features
- **Modular Design**: Independent structure implementations
- **Memory Efficiency**: Manual memory management control
- **Type Flexibility**: Generic implementations through `void*`
- **Circular List Support**: For doubly linked lists
